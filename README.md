*Un-ZIP and copy the "**_fonts**" and "**_icons**" folders to your "esphome" folder BEFORE you copy/paste the yaml in to ESPHome*

* 3D Printer files provided are as seen in the tutorial and can be used as a base model for your own 'Front Plate' mounting solutions.

## Please Be Aware:
* Depending on the supplier, SOME OLED displays have the VCC & GND (0v) pins reversed - Be sure to check and adjust your build accordingly.
